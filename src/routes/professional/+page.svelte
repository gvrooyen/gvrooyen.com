        <summary role="button">Executive Chairman at <b>Octoco</b></summary>
        <p>In early 2020, just before South Africa entered hard lockdown during the COVID pandemic, I started a tiny engineering
            consultancy with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hdelange/">Heinrich de Lange</a> just to share some overheads
            and clients. Before we knew it, <a href="https://octoco.ltd">Octoco Consulting</a> grew into a formidable team,
        serving clients across four continents.</p>
        <p>Octoco was originally conceived as an "outsourced CTO company" (hence the name) that provides a combination of
            technology and business development support to clients who do not have an experienced full-time CEO. Today,
            Octoco's services range from IoT design and software development, to C-level technology risk management,
        board advisory services, investment readiness support, and tech due diligence support.</p>

        <summary role="button">CEO at <b>Fanfire</b></summary>
        <p>Through <a href="https://octoco.ltd">Octoco</a> I've been supporting the <a href="https://www.alphawave.co.za/">Alphawave
                Group</a> with Innovation Management for a number of years. I led the conception of 
            <a href="https://scoutcloud.ai/">Scout</a>, from which <a href="https://bytefuse.ai/">ByteFuse</a> spun out.
            Currently I lead <a href="https://fanfire.ai/">Fanfire</a> &mdash; a company that uses emerging
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web3">Web3</a> technologies to support mainstream businesses
            outside of what would generally be considered &ldquo;crypto&rdquo;.</p>
        <p>Fanfire has helped commercialize the &ldquo;impossible&rdquo; land art of <a href="https://www.strijdom52.com/">
                Strijdom van der Merwe</a>, introduced a new way of collecting fine wine with
            <a href="https://vaulted.wine">Vaulted Wine</a>, and has made the creation of new NFT marketplaces affordable
            and fast with <a href="https://www.bodega.host/">Bodega</a>.</p>

        <summary role="button">Co-Founder and Director at <b>Custos Media Technologies</b></summary>
        <p>In 2013, during my tenure as Associate Professor in Electronic Engineering at <a href="https://www.sun.ac.za/">Stellenbosch 
        University</a>, we patented a technique to use blockchain bounties directly embedded into media files as a
    a way to trace the origin of piracy. This turned out to be one of the earliest patents describing a use case
    for what today would be called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token">NFTs</a>. The patent
    showed commercial value, and we spun out <a href="https://custostech.com/">Custos Media Technologies</a>. When the startup
    raised sufficient funding I resigned my academic position to lead Custos full-time. I stepped down as CEO in 2020, just
    before <a href="https://octoco.ltd">Octoco</a> was founded, but remain Director and technical advisor.</p>
        <p>Custos embeds a cryptocurrency secret direct into a media file by using forensic watermarks. For example, the
        Custos system can be used to hide a secret associated with the identity of a movie reviewer who receives a
        copy of a film before cinematic release. If the movie &ldquo;leaks&rdquo;, any recipient of the pirate film
        can use the secret to anonymously claim a cryptocurrency bounty, thus revealing the identity of the <i>original
        infringer</i>, namely the movie reviewer. We successfully applied the same concept to images, e-books, and other
        types of media as well.</p>

        <summary role="button">Extra-Ordinary Associate Professor in Industrial Engineering at <b>Stellenbosch University</b></summary>
        <p>In 2020 I briefly returned to <a href="https://www.sun.ac.za/">Stellenbosch University</a> as the 
            Research Chair in the Internet of Things. However, <a href="https://octoco.ltd/">Octoco</a> soon started
            growing rapidly and we co-founded <a href="https://fanfire.ai/">Fanfire</a>, where I took the helm. It
        soon became clear that my industry work was not compatible with a full-time academic position, and I resigned my tenure
        for a second time üôà.</p>
        <p>I retain my ties to academia as Extra-Ordinary Professor, with a strong interest in innovation management and technology
            transfer. My research supervision includes the Internet of Things and Blockchain applications, and I lecture on these
        topics as a small part of the Manufacturing Systems 314 module.</p>

        <summary role="button">Co-Founder of the <b>Media Lab</b> at Stellenbosch University</summary>
        <p>In 2007, Stellenbosch University was approached by <a href="https://naspers.com/">Naspers</a> to drive postgraduate
            research in the emerging field of ‚ÄúNew Media‚Äù &mdash; what we would today call Social Media and ‚ÄúWeb2‚Äù technologies.
            We set up a lab that worked on pre-commercial applied research on topics such as Augmented Reality, Gaming, E-Commerce,
        Broadband Connectivity, Computer Vision and Machine Learning. The lab itself was run a bit like a startup, and had a
        very strong focus on tech entrepreneurship.</p>
        <p>Today, the lab's alumni hold (sometimes very senior) positions with global leaders like 
            <a href="https://www.deepmind.com/">Deepmind</a>, <a href="https://youtube.com/">YouTube</a>, 
            <a href="https://sourcegraph.com">SourceGraph</a>, <a href="https://www.google.com">Google</a> and 
        <a href="https://www.aws.com/">Amazon Web Services</a>.</p>
        <p>In 2013, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/herman-engelbrecht-20828819">Prof Herman Engelbrecht</a> (my co-director at the 
            Lab), <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/fjlutz/">Fred Lutz</a> (then a Master's student in the Lab) and myself
            invented and patented the core blockchain technology underpinning <a href="https://custostech.com/">Custos Media
            Technologies</a>, which eventually spun out from the Lab.</p>
