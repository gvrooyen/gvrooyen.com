        <summary role="button">Executive Chairman at <b>Octoco</b></summary>
        <p>In early 2020, just before South Africa entered hard lockdown during the COVID pandemic, I started a tiny engineering
            consultancy with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hdelange/">Heinrich de Lange</a> just to share some overheads
            and clients. Before we knew it, <a href="https://octoco.ltd">Octoco Consulting</a> grew into a formidable team,
        serving clients across four continents.</p>
        <p>Octoco was originally conceived as an "outsourced CTO company" (hence the name) that provides a combination of
            technology and business development support to clients who do not have an experienced full-time CEO. Today,
            Octoco's services range from IoT design and software development, to C-level technology risk management,
        board advisory services, investment readiness support, and tech due diligence support.</p>
