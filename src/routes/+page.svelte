            <p>Hi there! I'm Gert-Jan, or just G-J for short.</p>
            <p>I'm Executive Chairman at <a href="https://octoco.ltd">Octoco</a>, an engineering consultancy that I co-founded in Stellenbosch, South
                Africa. Through Octoco I work at other companies I co-founded, including <a href="https://custostech.com">Custos</a>
                (information security) and <a href="https://fanfire.ai">Fanfire</a> (enterprise Web3
                solutions).</p>
            <p>I spent nearly two decades in academia before moving into business, and retain my ties with <a href=
            "https://www.sun.ac.za">Stellenbosch University</a> as Extra-Ordinary Associate Professor in <a href=
            "https://ie.sun.ac.za">Industrial Engineering</a>.</p>
